  <h1>For Linsu</h1>
  <p>
    This website is just one of the thousands of stars in the universe,
    trying to show how much I love you.

<section class="content">
  <h2>How it all started</h2>
  <p>
    People might think it all started when I first approached you, or when we held hands
    in the train just because of the crowd. Or maybe when we ran from our friends to catch
    an early train, standing near the door, blushing, flirting and smiling nonstop on that
    5:30 local from Vashi to Panvel. And yes, that moment was magical.
    <br><br>
    But for me, it started much earlier. It started the moment I saw you in our class.
    I don’t believe in love at first sight, but I knew one thing — you were going to mean
    something to me someday. And today, here we are, celebrating our second Valentine together.
    I couldn’t be happier.

  <h2>The day I fell harder</h2>
  <p>
    There were many moments when I fell for you, but one day I fell much harder.
    You walked into class wearing a kurta, and everything went silent for me.
    Your smile, your earrings, the way you carried yourself — everything was perfect.
    That day, without even talking much, I fell for you deeply.
  </p>

    With you, time slows down.  
    The world disappears.  
    Even silence feels full.  
    You are my comfort, my fun, my peace, my home.

<section class="content">
  <h2>Our Future</h2>
  <p>
    When I think about our future, I see us enjoying life the way we believe it should be.
    Not how the world tells us to live — but how we choose to.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Section 8 - Letter -->
<section class="letter">
  <h2>To Linsu</h2>
  <p class="address">Address: In Sahil’s heart ❤️</p>

  <p>
    There is a Japanese belief about a red string that connects people who are destined to be together.
    I believe that red string exists between us — tied to our fingers — not just for now,
    but for forever.
    <br><br>
    The moon reminds me that even when we are apart, we are still looking at the same sky.
    And love is like air — invisible, yet felt deeply in every part of the soul.
